"""
Put the captions into English.

Just under a third of the pool is catalogued in the language of whoever
wrote the card -- 3,820 German titles, 1,611 Dutch, 1,608 French, and so
on down to a few hundred Greek. Faithful to the object, no use at all to
somebody who cannot read it, and a panel has room for one caption rather
than two.

So the English replaces the original rather than sitting beside it. The
original stays in the pool either way, because a machine translation is
not the record and should never be mistaken for it -- it is a caption.

Translation is offline and free: Argos Translate, no key, no service to
depend on, language packs a couple of megabytes each. Roughly a second
per title, so the work is budgeted per run and cached forever in
translations.json, keyed by the *title* rather than by the card. That
last detail matters more than it sounds: 18,206 cards carry 15,876
distinct titles, and the duplicates are free.

Applied when daily.py loads the pool, not when harvest.py writes it, so
a better translation never needs a re-crawl.
