"""
Fold a pasted decision block into curation.json.

Reads a comment body on stdin, finds the ```queue block, and merges it.
Everything about this is deliberately suspicious: it is the one path
where text from a comment box becomes what a plugin serves, so it
refuses anything it does not fully understand rather than doing its
best with it.

What it checks, and why each one:

  the block is for this queue      a postcard block must not land in the
                                   maps repo and silently veto by id
  every id exists in the pool      a typo, a truncated paste or a block
                                   from an older pool would otherwise
                                   write ids that match nothing, and the
                                   mistake would be invisible
  reviewed_to only moves forward   the date is a high-water mark, so a
                                   block from inside a window already
                                   reviewed keeps the later date -- and
                                   its decisions still apply, because a
                                   sliding window means a fresh pass
                                   often sits inside an old one

Decisions are a union with what is already there, never a replacement:
a block carries only the window it covered, and treating it as the whole
truth would drop every earlier decision.

Prints a one-line summary for the workflow to comment back. Exit 1 on a
refusal, with the reason on stderr.
