"""
Fold a pasted decision block into curation.json.

Reads a comment body on stdin, finds the ```queue block, and merges it.
Everything about this is deliberately suspicious: it is the one path
where text from a comment box becomes what a plugin serves, so it
refuses anything it does not fully understand rather than doing its
best with it.

What it checks, and why each one:

  the block is for this queue      a postcard block must not land in the
                                   maps repo and silently veto by id
  every id exists in the pool      a typo, a truncated paste or a block
                                   from an older pool would otherwise
                                   write ids that match nothing, and the
                                   mistake would be invisible
  the window is not older than
  what has already been reviewed   pasting yesterday's block must not
                                   walk reviewed_to backwards and
                                   re-open a week already done

Decisions are a union with what is already there, never a replacement:
a block carries only the window it covered, and treating it as the whole
truth would drop every earlier decision.

Prints a one-line summary for the workflow to comment back. Exit 1 on a
refusal, with the reason on stderr.
